@* Prefetch scripts. [7PLBF20]
Safari and iOS doesn't support rel=prefetch â€” so the below stuff is for
everyone-except-for-those-who-use-Apple. Use rel=prefetch (not =preload), because the script is
only *perhaps* needed, and maybe not on this page but maybe on the next instead,
and, in Chrome, prefetch requests won't get terminated, when navigating to the next page
but pre*load* requests do get cancelled, see:
